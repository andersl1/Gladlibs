# Gladlibs
Online madlib-generation game using Google NLP for word tagging (POS) and tokenizing. 

This project was created in Unity using C# and PHP.  Blender was used to create animations, and original music was created and produced by the author.  A SQL database is used to store information regarding users and generated madlibs. 
This version uses Google Natural Language Processing for lexical analysis of uploaded text to tokenize and tag words for their parts of speech (POS).

Uploaded text is used to generate a madlib which creates blanks and prompts users for blank-created words with their respective POS.
